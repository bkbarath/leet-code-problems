I'm a **Software Engineer** at **KG Invicta Services**, based in **Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu**.  
I specialize in building **full-stack web applications** that are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.

My expertise spans across both **frontend** and **backend** development — crafting seamless **UI experiences** with  
`React`, `TypeScript`, and `Bootstrap`, while developing **robust REST APIs** using `Java` and `Spring Boot`  
connected to `PostgreSQL` and `MongoDB` databases.

I'm passionate about writing **clean**, **efficient**, and **production-ready code**,  
and continuously improving my skills in **software design**, **architecture**, and **performance optimization**.
